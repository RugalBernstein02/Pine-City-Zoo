                <p>The dusky leaf monkey, spectacled langur, or spectacled leaf monkey (<i>Trachypithecus obscurus</i>) is a species of primate in the family <i>Cercopithecidae</i>. It is found in Malaysia, Burma, and Thailand. These monkeys are excellent climbers and acrobats, often found jumping from tree to tree in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. They use their long tails for balance, and their prehensile tails are a great tool for grasping tree branches. Dusky leaf monkeys have a wide range of vocalizations, from soft whistling calls to louder grunts and honks. They use these sounds to communicate with each other in dense forest environments where visibility is limited. Their diet mostly consists of leaves, but they are also known to eat fruits and flowers. Their digestive system is specially adapted to break down tough plant matter. The leaves they eat are sometimes toxic to other animals, but the dusky leaf monkey can handle it thanks to their specialized stomachs. These monkeys are typically seen in small social groups led by a dominant male. Their social structure is relatively peaceful, with lots of grooming and play among members. Dusky leaf monkeys are considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and poaching. They live primarily in the forests of Malaysia and southern Thailand, and deforestation poses a big threat to their survival. These monkeys have a slow reproduction rate, with females giving birth to one infant at a time. The babies are born with a golden-orange fur coat, which eventually turns into the dark greyish fur seen in adults.Their tails are not just long but also incredibly flexible, allowing them to grab onto things and support their weight as they move through the treetops.</p>
